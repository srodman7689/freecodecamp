#Bonfire: Truncate a string

Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument). Return the truncated string with a '...' ending.

Note that the three dots at the end add to the string length.

Remember to use RSAP if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
