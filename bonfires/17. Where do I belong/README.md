#Bonfire: Where do I belong

Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into a sorted array (first argument).

For example, where([1,2,3,4], 1.5) should return 1 because it is greater than 1 (0th index), but less than 2 (1st index).

Remember to use RSAP if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
