#Bonfire: Inventory Update

Compare and update inventory stored in a 2d array against a second 2d array of a fresh delivery. Update current inventory item quantity, and if an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the inventory array in alphabetical order.

Remember to use RSAP if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
