#Bonfire: Return Largest Numbers in Arrays

Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.

Remember, you can iterate through an array with a simple for loop, and access each member with array syntax arr[i] .

If you are writing your own Chai.js tests, be sure to use a deep equal statement instead of an equal statement when comparing arrays.

Remember to use RSAP if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
