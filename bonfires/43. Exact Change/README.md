#Bonfire: Exact Change

Design a cash register drawer function that accepts purchase price as the first argument, payment as the second argument, and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.

cid is a 2d array listing available currency.

Return the string "Insufficient Funds" if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due. Return the string "Closed" if cash-in-drawer is equal to the change due.

Otherwise, return change in coin and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order.

Remember to use RSAP if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
